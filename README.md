# FDNavigation

An offline-first event navigation app prototype built for Female Daily, designed to enhance the visitor experience at large-scale beauty events like **Jakarta X Beauty**.

## 📱 Features

  Displays your exact location after scanning a QR code placed around the venue.

  All map and brand data are stored locally — no internet required.

- 📦 **Brand Discovery**  
  Filter and browse through makeup, skincare, and fragrance brands, each linked to their booth on the map.

- 🎯 **"You Are Here" Pin**  
  Visitors can easily orient themselves in crowded event spaces using strategically placed QR codes.

- 📌 **Dynamic Brand Highlighting**  
  Selecting a brand displays its booth on the map and shows detailed brand info.

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
